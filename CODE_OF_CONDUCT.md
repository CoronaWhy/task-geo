# Code of conduct

We expect all members of the Geo Task Force to act professionally and respectfully, and
we expect our social spaces to be safe and dignified environments.

Specifically:

* Respect people, their identities, their culture, and their work.
* Be kind. Be courteous. Be welcoming.
* Listen. Consider and acknowledge people's points before responding.

Should you experience anything that makes you feel unwelcome in this community, please contact the Geo Task Force team lead (@Daniel Rober-Nicoud and @Manuel Alvarez). We will not tolerate harassment or foul play from anyone. Failure to comply with the code of conduct will result in being removed from the repo/team.


## Questions

It's always ok to ask questions. This task is large and full of creative potential. No one person will be an expert in every part of our final product, and that's okay. If you find an interesting answer to a problem, make that solution known and document where you found your answer, this will help the next person get up to speed even quicker.

!["I try not to make fun of people for admitting they don't know things, because for each thing 'everyone knows' by the time they're adults, every day there are, on average, 10,000 people in the US hearing about it for the first time. If I make fun of people, I train them not to tell me when they have those moments. And I miss out on the fun." "Diet coke and mentos thing? What's that?" "Oh man! We're going to the grocery store." "Why?" "You're one of today's lucky 10,000."](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ten_thousand.png)
